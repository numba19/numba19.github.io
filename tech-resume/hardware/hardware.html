It was my gate way drug into the world of video games and technology. Even though I got it long after the DSi came out, and even though the resoloution was absolutley garbage, I loved that thing to <b>DEATH</b>!</p>

                <p>Ahhh, the Xbox 360. It has to be the one peice of technology that I had used for the longest amount of time. I got an Xbox 360 a year earlier than when the Xbox one came out, which means I actualy had a relevent console. I played on the Xbox until 2018, 6 years of Minecraft, kinect sports, and of Lego starwars. That was the best time of my life. The Xbox was also a gateway drug in a way because it opened up the world of online gaming to me.

It has a Gtx 960m which was more than enough for the games I play. I played <b>MANY</b> hours of Minecraft, Plants versus Zombies: Garden Warfare and Terratech. Funny enough this was another gateway drug as it opened my eyes to the power and performance of computers.

                <p>This is the  plot twist of the story: My dads phone contract ran out and he renewed it. He got a new phone from this company called Motorola. I had never heard of such a company anmd was really interested in the phone. I finally saw that android is great, and has many cool features that Apple just couldn't compete with. So finally me and my dad agreed that I would get the phone. I was shocked at how much screen there was and how there was no need for massive bezels with cluncky home buttons. I finally switched back to android.

                <p> I love Motorola phones now because of how they are so cheap, and well made. My Motorola has a wide angle lense and a standard lense, which shoots at 48 megapixels (divided by 4 because of Software). It lasts me all day and sometimes lasts into the next. I don't think I will be buying any other phones other than Motorola's unless the go bankrupt!
